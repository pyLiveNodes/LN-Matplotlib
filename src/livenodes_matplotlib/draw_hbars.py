# The draw pattern works as follows:
# 1. init_draw is called externally by matplotlib or qt and provides access to the subfig.
#   -> use this to setup axes, paths etc
# 2. init_draw returns a update function which is also called externally and does not receive any inputs
#   -> this should only interface the update calls on matplotlib using data stored in the attributes of the class instance
# 3. receive_data is called by the pipeline and receives the data as well as potential meta information or other data channels
#   -> calculate the data you will render in the update fn from draw_init
#
# The main advantage of this is, that the pipeline and render loops are separated and one doesn't slow down the other
